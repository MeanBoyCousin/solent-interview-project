# Interview practical test

## Setup

You'll need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and a code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed. ✅

Clone this project using git. ✅

Install NPM modules with `npm install` ✅

Run the project with `npm start` ✅

## Instructions

The aim of this task is to produce a profile listing component that uses the [RandomUser](https://randomuser.me/) API. ✅

**Requirements:**

-   On page load, 10 random profiles showing their avatar and name should be listed. ✅
-   These profiles can be filtered by their name with a text input box. ✅
-   When clicking one of the profile items, this needs to take the user to a new page or open a pop-up modal, that gives more details about the person they have clicked on. ✅
-   It needs to match the designs given, be responsive, and use the assets provided. ✅
-   Only needs to work in Chrome. ✅

## Create component/requirements

You should create your component(s) in the components folder located in `/src/app/components`. ✅

You can show the profile details on a new page using React Router, in which you just need to add a new route to the `routes.js` file located in `/src/core/routing/`. Or create a pop-up model to show the data if you don't wish to use React router. ✅

You should use Styled Components for styling your components. You can find documentation for Styled Components [here](https://styled-components.com/). ✅

## Submission

Once complete, push them up to a repository you've created on a git hosting platform of your choice.
